RNN Encoder Decoder for real-time time series prediction. The code is offline implementation but sequential(imitating real time). As each time series sample comes into the network, RNN predicts the 10th(user defined) time step ahead.This is especially useful for many applications like real time dynamic prediction events like collision, explosion etc.This code was inspired from the offline implementation of the RNN encoder decoder in this blog:https://weiminwang.blog/2017/09/29/multivariate-time-series-forecast-using-seq2seq-in-tensorflow/. Used many to many model to account the dependence of time steps on previous time steps. Using many to many Neural Network model,  we get a number of values(determined by user) for a single acceleration value.Mean value gave us improved prediction results for our high rate sampled data.Parts of this code like filename, input data size etc needs to be modified according to the data user inputs.
